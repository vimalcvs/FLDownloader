# How to use Ketch

## Installation

To integrate Ketch library into your Android project, follow these simple steps:

- Update your settings.gradle file with the following dependency.

```Groovy
dependencyResolutionManagement {
    repositoriesMode.set(RepositoriesMode.FAIL_ON_PROJECT_REPOS)
    repositories {
        google()
        mavenCentral()
        maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' } // this one
    }
}
```

- Update your module level build.gradle file with the following dependency.

```Groovy
dependencies {
    implementation 'com.github.khushpanchal:Ketch:1.0.0'
}
```

## Usage

- Simplest way to use Ketch:

    - Inside Activity or Fragment, create the instance of Ketch

      ```Kotlin
        private lateinit var ketch: Ketch
        override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
          super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
          ketch = Ketch.init(this)
        }
      ```

    - Call the download() function, pass the url, and get callback

      ```Kotlin
        val request = ketch.download(url,
          onQueue = {},
          onStart = { length -> },
          onProgress = { progress, speedInBytePerMs, length -> },
          onSuccess = { },
          onFailure = { error -> },
          onCancel = { }
        )
      ```

  ### Important Note: Add the appropriate storage permission based on API level or onFailure(error) callback will be triggered. Check out sample app for reference.

- To cancel the download

  ```Kotlin
      ketch.cancel(request.id)
  ```

- To enable the notification:

    - Add the notification permission in manifest file.

       ```
        <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.POST_NOTIFICATIONS"/>
       ```

    - Request permission from user (required from Android 13 (API level 33)). Check out sample app
      for reference.
    - Pass the notification config while initialization

      ```Kotlin
        ketch = Ketch.init(this,
                 notificationConfig = NotificationConfig(
                     enabled = true,
                     smallIcon = R.drawable.ic_launcher_foreground // It is required to pass the smallIcon for notification.
                 )
               )
      ```

## Customisation

- Provide file name and path for download. (It is recommended to pass the fileName or library will
  assign random name)

  ```Kotlin
  ketch.download(url,
   path, //Default path: Download directory
   fileName //Default fileName: Random UUID.
  )
  ```

- Provide headers with network request.

  ```Kotlin
  ketch.download(url,
   headers = headers, //Default: Empty hashmap
  )
  ```

- Tag: Group various downloads by providing additional Tag. (This tag can be use to cancel the
  download as well)

  ```Kotlin
  ketch.download(url,
   tag = tag, //Default: null
  )
  ```

- Cancellation: In addition to cancel by request id, provides cancellation by tag and cancel all
  downloads.

  ```Kotlin
    ketch.cancel(tag)
  ```

  ```Kotlin
    ketch.cancelAll()
  ```

- Observing: Provides state flow of download items (Each item carries download info like url,
  fileName, path, tag, status, progress, length, timeQueued, speed, id)

  ```Kotlin
    //To observe from Fragment
    viewLifecycleOwner.lifecycleScope.launch {
      repeatOnLifecycle(Lifecycle.State.STARTED) {
        ketch.observeDownloads()
          .collect { 
             //set items to adapter
          }
      }
    }
    //observe from viewModel to survive configuration change
  ```

  ```Kotlin
    // To stop observing
    ketch.stopObserving()
  ```

- Download config: Provides custom connect and read timeout

  ```Kotlin
    ketch = Ketch.init(this,
                downloadConfig = DownloadConfig(
                    connectTimeOutInMs = 20000L, //Default: 10000L
                    readTimeOutInMs = 15000L //Default: 10000L
                )
              )
  ```

- Notification config: Provide custom notification config

  ```Kotlin
    ketch = Ketch.init(this,
                notificationConfig = NotificationConfig(
                   enabled = true, //Default: false
                   channelName = channelName, //Default: "File Download"
                   channelDescription = channelDescription, //Default: "Notify file download status"
                   importance = importance, //Default: NotificationManager.IMPORTANCE_HIGH
                   smallIcon = smallIcon, //It is required
                )
              )
  ```
